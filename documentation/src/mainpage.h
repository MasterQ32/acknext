 * ## Philosophy
 * 
 *
 * ## Technology
 * This game engine builds on a serious of open source libraries
 * that are quite standard in game development.
 *
 * **SDL2** is used as a framework to provide platform independent
 * access to the window system as well as providing input.
 * 
 * **ODE**, the open dynamics engine is a physics engine that provides
 * a very precise and flexible physics simulation engine.
 * Even when not using physics, one can profit from the collision engine
 * brought with ODE.
 * 
 * **Assimp** is a library that allows importing a bunch of different
 * 3D model files from different eras. Acknext can use models in the
 * modern COLLADA format or even go back to use models from Quake 2.
 *
 * For rendering, **OpenGL 4.5** is used and the binding is done by
 * **gl3w**, an easy-to-use binding for the OpenGL core functions as 
 * well as extensions.
